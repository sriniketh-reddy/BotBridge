# üß† BotBridge ‚Äî Personalized MCP Client Web Application

**BotBridge** is a next-generation **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** client web application built for **end users**.  
Unlike a traditional chatbot, **BotBridge** acts as your **personal digital operator** ‚Äî connecting to MCP tools and automating tasks across your daily-used applications with simple natural language prompts.

---

## üöÄ What Makes BotBridge Unique?

BotBridge is **not** just another chatbot interface.  
It is a **personalized MCP client** that dynamically connects to MCP tools hosted on platforms like [mcp.composio.dev](https://mcp.composio.dev) to perform real digital actions on behalf of the user.

### ‚ú® Example Use Case

> üßë‚Äçüíª **User Prompt:**  
> ‚ÄúCreate a text file with top 10 current tech news in my Google Drive.‚Äù

**BotBridge Workflow:**
1. Understands the user‚Äôs intent.  
2. Searches for the required MCP tools (e.g., news-fetcher, Google Drive writer).  
3. ‚úÖ If the necessary tools are available, BotBridge executes the task seamlessly.  
4. ‚ùå If not, it informs the user:
   - ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt complete this action because no relevant tools are connected.‚Äù  
   - Suggests adding MCP servers that contain the needed tools (e.g., `news.mcp.composio.dev`, `gdrive.mcp.composio.dev`).

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Overview

BotBridge operates as an **MCP Host**, enabling:
- Secure communication between the chatbot and MCP servers.  
- Tool discovery, connection, and invocation through standardized protocols.  
- Action automation pipelines built on **React Native (Web + Mobile)**.  

Integration with **Pipedream workflows** allows BotBridge to interact with external services efficiently, enabling smooth and secure execution of user actions.

## Deployment / Base URLs

Set `BASE_URL` in `backend/.env` (see `.env.example`) to control where the server binds and the allowed CORS origin. Set `VITE_API_BASE_URL` in the frontend environment (see `frontend/.env.example`) so the frontend points to the correct backend when deployed.

### CORS and credentials (important)

If your frontend sends requests with credentials (cookies) ‚Äî which this app does to persist the backend session cookie ‚Äî the backend must return Access-Control-Allow-Origin set to the exact origin of the frontend (not "*") and include Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true. To make this easy in development, set `FRONTEND_ORIGIN` in `backend/.env` to match your Vite dev URL (for example `http://localhost:5173`).

Example:

- `FRONTEND_ORIGIN=http://localhost:5173`

If you change the Vite dev server port (Vite may choose a different port when the default is occupied), update `FRONTEND_ORIGIN` accordingly.

### Firebase setup (frontend)

Create a Firebase project and enable Email/Password sign-in. Add the web app configuration values into `frontend/.env` (see `frontend/.env.example`). The frontend uses the Firebase client SDK to sign in users and exchanges the ID token with the backend `/api/auth/verify-token` endpoint to obtain a backend JWT.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Install & Run (Local Development)

Follow these steps to run the frontend and backend locally. Both services are independent; you can run them in separate terminals.

### Backend (Express + Firebase Admin)

1. Open a terminal and change to the backend folder:

```powershell
cd backend
```

2. Install dependencies:

```powershell
npm install
```

3. Create a `.env` file in the `backend/` folder (see `.env.example`) and set the required variables (service account or JSON string, JWT secret, port):

Required `.env` variables:

- `PORT` ‚Äî port the server listens on (default: 4000)
- `BASE_URL` ‚Äî full base URL for CORS (e.g. `http://localhost:4000`)
- `FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_PATH` ‚Äî local path to your Firebase service account JSON (or set `FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_JSON` with the JSON contents)
- `JWT_SECRET` ‚Äî a random secret for signing backend JWTs

4. Start the backend in development mode:

```powershell
npm run dev
```

The backend will listen on `http://localhost:4000` (or the PORT you set).

### Frontend (Vite + React + Tailwind)

1. Open a new terminal and change to the frontend folder:

```powershell
cd frontend
```

2. Install dependencies:

```powershell
npm install
```

3. Create a `.env` file in the `frontend/` folder (you can copy `frontend/.env.example`) and set the Firebase variables and `VITE_API_BASE_URL`:

Required `frontend/.env` variables:

- `VITE_API_BASE_URL` ‚Äî backend API base URL (e.g. `http://localhost:4000`)
- `VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY` ‚Äî Firebase web apiKey
- `VITE_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN`
- `VITE_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID`
- `VITE_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET`
- `VITE_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID`
- `VITE_FIREBASE_APP_ID`

4. Start the frontend dev server:

```powershell
npm run dev
```

Open the browser at the local Vite URL (usually `http://localhost:5173`) and the frontend will call the backend at `VITE_API_BASE_URL`.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Environment Variables Summary

Backend (`backend/.env`)

```text
PORT=4000
BASE_URL=http://localhost:4000
# Either a path to the service account JSON file or the JSON itself
FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_PATH=./serviceAccountKey.json
# or
FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_JSON={...}
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret_here
```

Frontend (`frontend/.env`)

```text
VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:4000
VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY=...
VITE_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=...
VITE_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=...
VITE_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=...
VITE_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=...
VITE_FIREBASE_APP_ID=...
```

Notes:
- Keep your Firebase service account JSON file out of source control. Add it to `.gitignore` (already included).
- For production, use secure secret management (e.g., environment variables in your hosting platform, secret manager, or CI/CD secrets).
